# Soda can VAWT #

## What is a VAWT? ##

"A vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) is a type of wind turbine where the main rotor shaft is set transverse to the wind (but not necessarily vertically) while the main components 
are located at the base of the turbine. This arrangement allows the generator and gearbox to be located close to the ground, facilitating service and repair. VAWTs do not need to 
be pointed into the wind, which removes the need for wind-sensing and orientation mechanisms. Major drawbacks for the early designs (Savonius, Darrieus and giromill) 
included the significant torque variation or "ripple" during each revolution, and the large bending moments on the blades. Later designs addressed the torque ripple issue by
sweeping the blades helically (Gorlov type). Savonius vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWT) are not widespread, but their simplicity and better performance in disturbed 
flow-fields, compared to small horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWT) make them a good alternative for distributed generation devices in urban environment." - Wikipedia

## Point of this project ##

For me, the number one reason why I do anything is just because "I feel like it", and have trouble elaborating further. I do not remember when I got interested in VAWTs, but I
believe it was after I watched a single youtube video on them, which sparked my interest.

What is important about this wind turbine in particular, is that I am utilizing recycled soda cans from the copious amounts of sparkling water that I drink. I had hundreds of cans
lying around that I refuse to throw out, so why not use them? The other components of the design are 3D printed parts, aluminum shafts, steel sticks (or whatever you can call a
thin rod made of steel), PVC pipes, and bearings. At the current time of writing, I have not started working on the electronics side of the project.
