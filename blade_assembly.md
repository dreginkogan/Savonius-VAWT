# Blade assembly instructions

- Note: this is for the metal parts of the turbine blades. These instructions don't include how to attach it to the rest of the turbine. For that, look at the cad files.

### Materials needed

- 12x aluminum cans (large blade) || 6x aluminum cans (small blade)
- Aluminum tape
- Duct tape
  
### Assembly

1. Turn soda cans into sheets (this tutorial can help: https://craftyjournal.com/how-to-turn-a-soda-can-into-a-flat-sheet-of-aluminum/)
2. Tile the sheets together into a 2x6 arrangement for a large blade, or 1x3 for a small one. (horizontal x vertical)
3. Tape the sheets together using aluminum tape. Be sure to cover the gaps between them on both sides.
4. Due to imperfections in cutting the aluminum (unless you've done it perfectly), there may be bumps on the blade. In order to "get rid of" them, you can smoosh them down with someting heavy.
5. Cover the edges and the interior face (the blade will try to curl inwards once you tape the cans together) of the blade with duct tape.
6. Repeat these steps a second time, in order for you to have two blades.
